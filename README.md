# HTTP endpoint

## Overview
The HTTP endpoint allows to make HTTP requests as well as receive HTTP request from
other servers. This is the list of features:

- Send HTTP requests (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, etc.) to other servers
- Receive external HTTP requests (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, etc.)
- Download files
- Support for basic and digest authentication
- Support for cookies

In many cases you can use the HTTP endpoint to call external services where an official
endpoint does not exist. This will work as long as they provide a REST HTTP API.

For more information please refer to [docs](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/endpoints_http.html).
